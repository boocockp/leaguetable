LSD Writing Subjects
====================

- Setting up AWS - node script vs Cloud Formation vs manual; it's code, can debug in Idea; CFN slooow
- Receiving email with aws - ducks in a row, validates when set up, how to test non-receipt, error metrics, reason for not working - not active
- Lambda functions - structuring code, esp if shared with client.  AWS SDK auth needed is different.  Include local modules.  install from npm in each dir
- Using same code in node and browser: require and module in npm vs browser, es6 in browser vs es5 on AWS
