Ideas
-----
- Speed up recalc by indexing inputs
- General purpose watcher on any value linked to input notifications
- Memoizing easier on functional objects, as most functions are no-args properties
- Maybe functions with args have to be functional objects, so can be memoized - eg BalanceSheet
- Memoizing getters with complex calcs (LeagueTable, Team) gets cold performance close to cached sequences
- Incremental additions still same as cold for memoized, but much quicker for cached sequence
- Memoizing simple getters (MatchResult, TeamResult) is actually slower by 50% - 100%
- Calculating TeamResult and MatchResult props in constructor and storing made no measurable difference - presumably only called once anyway
