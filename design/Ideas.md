=====

- Some outputs are also just sequences of values, even if recalculated each time
- Actions can attach to outputs and do something with each new one - how tell which are new?
- Subscribe to outputs
- Time is a sequence of inputs
- A timed output can be just a function that ranges over a time sequence input
- Testing easy if time is just another input
