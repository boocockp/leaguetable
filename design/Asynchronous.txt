Asynchronous Issues
===================

Inputs
------

- Inputs initiated from outside
- Inputs naturally async
- Inputs sequential though async
- Inputs must all be reproduced

Lookups
-------

- Lookups initiated from inside
- Don't need to be reproduced in same sequence
- Would normally only do lookup for latest value
- Often want to cache the returned value

Use in functional model
-----------------------

- Want to use like a normal function
- When evaluated first time, needs to initiate async call and return placeholder (undefined?)
- When async call returns, need to cache the value and force re-evaluation of the sheet
- Need to ensure as little as possible is re-evaluated
- Need to debounce rate of re-evaluation

Async updates
-------------
- If a retrieved value can update, cache it and force re-evaluation

Promises vs Sequences
---------------------

- Sometimes an async input is initiated by the receiver eg uploaded object control getting file from file store
- In this case returning a Promise is clearer than async data flows with correlation ids
