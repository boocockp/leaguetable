==============================

Main points
-----------

- User pairing - quick enough to develop in front of users
- Daily iterations
- Event sourcing
- Functional modelling
- Models and views are all just functions
- Functions are live
- Reactive web components
- Data flows

- Client side processing from raw events
- Simple storage
- Tests run in browser
- Tests use model where possible
- Tests also act as specs and help guides
- No builds
- Deploy = copy files
- Backup/restore = copy files


Other points
------------

- Cached sequences
- Permissions for input types and properties within them
- Permissions for reading events and properties within them
- Database as cache
- Page wiring

Unique bits
-----------

- Function over all inputs, rather than applying changes to objects

Advantages
