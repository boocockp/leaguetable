Areas to explore
----------------

- App as "worksheet" object
- Input mechanism
- Observing output changes
- View controls like sort by name are inputs to a downstream view functional model
- Teleprinter output when result(s) added
- Persistence
- Performance optimisation
- Multiple inputs
- Async data access
- Performing actions with outputs
- Time-based functions
- Time-travel or 'as at' views eg league table on dates in past
